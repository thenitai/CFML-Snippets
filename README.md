CFML (Coldfusion) and Fusebox Snippets for Sublime Text 2

These are a bunch of CFML (Colfusion) and Fusebox snippets for the fabolous Sublime Text 2 Editor. These snippets by no means complete, but I will be creating more as time goes by.

Of course, any help and contributions are welcomed :)

Installation
------------

No package control yet, so simply grab them from here and drop them into your "USER" folder inside the packages, e.g. "~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User"
