CFML (Coldfusion) and Fusebox Snippets for Sublime Text 2

These are a bunch of CFML (Colfusion) and Fusebox snippets for the fabolous Sublime Text 2 Editor. These snippets are by no means complete, but I will be creating more as time goes by.

Of course, any help and contributions is welcomed (pull requests are accepted).

Hope this helps you as much as it helps my coding every day.

Installation
------------

No package control yet, so simply grab them from here and drop them into your "USER" folder inside the packages:

	"~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User"
